blurb: "Curiosity killed the cat. Or so the saying goes ... all Klane can hope is that curiosity doesn't also kill gnomes. Klane is an uncharacteristically adventurous individual, who's been smitten with the urge to explore places of the world few people--let alone hill gnomes--would dare to go. Since he was able, he has sailed down the Amethyst River and her many distributaries to satisfy his wanderlust. When Klane finds himself in the bowels of an abandoned mine and in possession of a valuable stone, and a dead miner's journal, he knows his days of minor adventure are over."
