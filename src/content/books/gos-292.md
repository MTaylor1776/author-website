Cybersecurity Consultant Thomas Pilkersley spent most of his life running away from life's problems. Gambling debts? Run. Loan sharks and organized religions? Run farther. Lucrative job contracts? Bribe and fake your way to the next paycheck. A paycheck you'll use to fuel your self-destructive ways and repeat the vicious cycle.

Now, stepping aboard the Intergalactic Federation of Free Planet's largest orbital cemetery, Geostationary Orbital Station 292 alongside two extremely qualified consultants, Thomas is trapped with no escape from his identity, his mortality, or a terrible government cover-up that will surely be the death of him. It turns out that the grass isn't always greener, and living with debt, imposter syndrome, and loan sharks are preferable options to dying in a cold, decaying, orbital coffin at the hands of things that should've stayed dead.
