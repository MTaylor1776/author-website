Racing to evade capture by his cohorts at the Department of Inquiry and clear his name, his former enemy becomes his greatest ally. With his glitchy AI, Keeper, and diplomatic firecracker Delora by his side—and the Federation's guns at his back—Jax knows the only path to salvation is forward.

But an intergalactic balancing act of deadly proportions is underway as two mighty empires teeter on the brink of war. On a breakneck tour across exotic planets, corporate space stations, and nostalgic hometown streets, friendly faces greet Jax while deadly hands work in the shadows. Encountering difficult dilemmas at every turn, Jax must confront dark truths about his loyalty and limits…before his stars-damned luck runs out.
