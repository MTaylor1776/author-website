The Intergalactic Federation of Free Planets and Jax Jensen have been given a chance to rebuild themselves from ruin. The former, restoring its image; the latter his life. Jax Jensen is back with the Department of Inquiry for one final mission: capture the man who nearly killed him and an entire civilization. With former War Minister Quarenza's coup crushed, it should be an easy fugitive retrieval with Delora and Keeper by his side.

However, the maliciously cunning use noble ideas to mask their agendas, and the fight isn't over until the enemy surrenders. With the emergence of a fringe governmental agency and a potent new leader, the Federation's democratic existence is not guaranteed. Perhaps Quarenza was the pawn, not the king. Perhaps Haaken's vengeance was not contained by the grave. And perhaps Jax's internal struggles will tear him apart more violently than anything he's faced before.
