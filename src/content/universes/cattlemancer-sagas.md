Welcome to the continent of Bribane, a land caught between the promise of a Gilded Age and the horrors of an ancient, magical world. Here, the great Republic of Bribane pushes ever forward, its path forged by steam-powered railways and the relentless ambition of its industrial barons. But civilization is a fragile veneer. In the boardrooms of the elite, a secret cabal known as The Company uses magically-fueled enforcers to crush their rivals and control the nation's destiny.

*For those who enjoy: A dark fantasy that blends the industrial grit of Gaslamp with the supernatural horror of the Weird West. If you like stories of secret societies, morally complex heroines, and a magic system that feels as dangerous as a faulty steam engine, you'll feel right at home in Bribane.*
