Step into Taramore — a world of flying ships, magical stones, and high adventure. The winds carry more than whispers here; they carry entire fleets across the sky, powered by ancient stones whose origins have long been forgotten. On the ground and in the air, the fate of kingdoms rests on the shoulders of those who least expect it.

Epic in scope yet intimate in character, the Winds of Taramore series explores themes of duty, identity, and the power of choice in a world that demands everything.
