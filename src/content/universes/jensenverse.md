Welcome to the Jensenverse — a sprawling science fiction universe where humanity has reached the stars but hasn't outrun its demons. Follow Jax Jensen through a galaxy where survival demands sacrifice, loyalty is a currency, and every choice carries weight.

These are carefully-crafted, character-driven stories set against a backdrop of interstellar conflict, political intrigue, and the quiet moments between the chaos that define who we really are.
